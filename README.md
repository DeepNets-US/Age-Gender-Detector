# Age and Gender Detector

## Overview

Welcome to the Age and Gender Detector project! This AI-powered application uses advanced facial analysis to predict the gender and estimate the age of individuals in images. The project features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.

## Getting Started

Before running the application, make sure to decompress the weights file.

1. **Decompress Weights File:**
   - Locate the compressed weights file (e.g., `weights.zip`).
   - Decompress the file to extract the model weights.

## Running the GUI

### Option 1: GUI via Command Line

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

### Option 2: Manual GUI Run

1. Open your preferred Python environment or IDE.
2. Open the `gui.py` file.
3. Run the script.

## Note

Before running the GUI in any way, ensure the weights file is decompressed. The weights file is compressed as a ZIP to reduce size.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebooks and other Python files in the repository for a deeper understanding of the project.

Happy detecting! ðŸš€
